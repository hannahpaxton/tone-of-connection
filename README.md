# ðŸŽ¨ Tone of Connection 

Tone of Connection is a full-stack web application that analyzes a userâ€™s mood and translates it to color. It acts as a journal that captures emotional snapshots by prompting users with a random self-care focused question to elicit rich responses that are analyzed for tone qualities. The results are then run through an algorithm that produces a uniquely saturated color that corresponds to the intensity of the detected tone qualities in the post. 

The color of the most resonant tone is then used to style a marker on an anonymized map where users can explore posts from others all over the U.S. Users can also look back on all of their previous posts to reflect on their emotional journey.
